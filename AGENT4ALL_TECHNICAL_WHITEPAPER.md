## Mathematical Framework

### 3.1 Weight Distribution Model

The weight distribution follows a modified PageRank algorithm with temporal decay:

**Weight Calculation:**
```
W_i(t) = α * S_i(t) + (1-α) * W_i(t-1) * γ^Δt
```

Where:
- `W_i(t)`: Weight of miner i at time t
- `S_i(t)`: Score of miner i at time t
- `α`: Learning rate (0.1 ≤ α ≤ 0.3)
- `γ`: Decay factor (0.95 ≤ γ ≤ 0.99)
- `Δt`: Time difference since last update

**Score Normalization:**
```
S_i(t) = (R_i(t) - μ_R(t)) / σ_R(t)
```

Where:
- `R_i(t)`: Raw reward for miner i
- `μ_R(t)`: Mean reward across all miners
- `σ_R(t)`: Standard deviation of rewards

### 3.2 Performance Metrics

#### Response Time Scoring
```
RT_score = max(0, 1 - (RT_actual / RT_threshold))
```

#### Success Rate Calculation
```
SR = (successful_requests / total_requests) * 100
```

#### Health Score Formula
```
Health = (SR * 0.6 + RT_score * 0.4) * (1 - failure_penalty)
```

Where:
- `failure_penalty = min(1, consecutive_failures / max_failures)`

### 3.3 Consensus Mechanism

**Validator Agreement:**
```
Consensus_Score = Σ(w_i * v_i) / Σ(w_i)
```

Where:
- `w_i`: Weight of validator i
- `v_i`: Vote of validator i (0 or 1)

**Threshold for Agreement:**
```
Threshold = 2/3 * total_validator_weight
```

## Network Growth Dynamics

### 4.1 Miner Growth Model

The number of miners follows a logistic growth function:

```
N_miners(t) = K / (1 + (K - N_0) / N_0 * e^(-r*t))
```

Where:
- `K`: Carrying capacity (maximum sustainable miners)
- `N_0`: Initial number of miners
- `r`: Growth rate
- `t`: Time

**Growth Rate Calculation:**
```
r = (reward_rate * success_rate) / (cost_rate + competition_factor)
```

### 4.2 User Adoption Curve

User adoption follows a modified Bass diffusion model:

```
dN_users/dt = p * (M - N_users) + q * (N_users/M) * (M - N_users)
```

Where:
- `p`: Innovation coefficient
- `q`: Imitation coefficient
- `M`: Market potential
- `N_users`: Current users

### 4.3 Network Effects

**Metcalfe's Law Application:**
```
Network_Value = c * N²
```

Where:
- `c`: Constant factor
- `N`: Number of connected nodes

**Enhanced Network Value:**
```
Enhanced_Value = c * Σ(w_i * w_j * connectivity_ij)
```

Where:
- `w_i, w_j`: Weights of nodes i and j
- `connectivity_ij`: Connection strength between nodes

---

## Incentive Mechanism

### 5.1 Reward Distribution

**Base Reward Formula:**
```
Base_Reward = (stake_weight * performance_score * category_multiplier) / total_stake
```

**Performance Score Components:**
```
Performance_Score = Σ(metric_i * weight_i)
```

Metrics include:
- Response time (30%)
- Success rate (25%)
- User satisfaction (20%)
- Uptime (15%)
- Resource efficiency (10%)

### 5.2 Category-Specific Incentives

**Category Multiplier:**
```
Category_Multiplier = base_multiplier * (1 + demand_factor * scarcity_factor)
```

Where:
- `demand_factor`: User demand for category
- `scarcity_factor`: Inverse of category saturation

### 5.3 Validator Rewards

**Validator Compensation:**
```
Validator_Reward = (stake * consensus_participation * accuracy) / total_validator_stake
```

**Accuracy Calculation:**
```
Accuracy = 1 - |predicted_score - actual_score| / max_score
```

---

## Security and Consensus

### 6.1 Cryptographic Security

**Model Integrity Verification:**
```
Hash_Verification = SHA256(model_data + salt) == stored_hash
```

**Digital Signature Verification:**
```
Signature_Valid = verify_signature(message, public_key, signature)
```

### 6.2 Sybil Attack Prevention

**Stake-Based Protection:**
```
Sybil_Resistance = min(stake_required, computational_cost)
```

**Reputation System:**
```
Reputation = Σ(historical_performance * time_decay)
```

### 6.3 Consensus Protocol

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance:**
```
BFT_Threshold = (2/3 * total_validators) + 1
```

**Weighted Consensus:**
```
Consensus_Weight = Σ(validator_stake * validator_accuracy)
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### 7.1 Load Balancing Algorithm

**Request Distribution:**
```
Load_Balance = min(load_factor * health_score * availability)
```

**Failover Mechanism:**
```
Failover_Trigger = (response_time > threshold) OR (success_rate < minimum)
```

### 7.2 Caching Strategy

**Cache Hit Ratio:**
```
Cache_Efficiency = cache_hits / (cache_hits + cache_misses)
```

**Cache Invalidation:**
```
TTL = base_ttl * (1 + popularity_factor)
```

### 7.3 Resource Management

**CPU Utilization:**
```
CPU_Optimal = min(80%, current_load + buffer)
```

**Memory Management:**
```
Memory_Efficiency = used_memory / allocated_memory
```
