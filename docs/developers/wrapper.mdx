# Include agent4all package in your project

## Option 1: Using RAW YAML

```python
from agent4all import Agent4ALL

# Example agent_yaml content
agent_yaml = """
framework: "crewai"
topic: "Space Exploration"

roles:
  astronomer:
    role: "Space Researcher"
    goal: "Discover new insights about {topic}"
    backstory: "You are a curious and dedicated astronomer with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos."
    tasks:
      investigate_exoplanets:
        description: "Research and compile information about exoplanets discovered in the last decade."
        expected_output: "A summarized report on exoplanet discoveries, including their size, potential habitability, and distance from Earth."
"""

# Create a Agent4ALL instance with the agent_yaml content
agent4all = Agent4ALL(agent_yaml=agent_yaml)

# Run Agent4ALL
result = agent4all.run()

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Option 2: Using separate agents.yaml file


Note: Please create agents.yaml file before hand. 

```python
from agent4all import Agent4ALL

def basic(): # Basic Mode
    agent4all = Agent4ALL(agent_file="agents.yaml")
    agent4all.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    basic()
```

## Other options

```python
from agent4all import Agent4ALL

def basic(): # Basic Mode
    agent4all = Agent4ALL(agent_file="agents.yaml")
    agent4all.run()
    
def advanced(): # Advanced Mode with options
    agent4all = Agent4ALL(
        agent_file="agents.yaml",
        framework="autogen", # use AG2 framework (Formerly AutoGen)
    )
    agent4all.run()
    
def auto(): # Full Automatic Mode
    agent4all = Agent4ALL(
        auto="Create a movie script about car in mars",
        framework="autogen" # use AG2 framework
    )
    print(agent4all.framework)
    agent4all.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    basic()
    advanced()
    auto()
```
