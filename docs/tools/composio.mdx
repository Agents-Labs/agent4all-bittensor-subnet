# Composio Agent4ALL Integration

[Composio](https://composio.dev/) allows AI agents and LLMs to easily integrate with 100+ tools (GitHub, Gmail, CodeExecution and more) to perform actions and subscribe to triggers. This example will show how to integrate Composio with Agent4ALL agents to let them seamlessly interact with external apps.

```bash
pip install composio-agent4all
```

To add Composio's Serpapi tool - 

```bash
composio add serpapi
```

```python
from agent4all import Agent4ALL
from composio_praisonai import Action, ComposioToolSet

# Initialize Composio's Toolset
composio_toolset = ComposioToolSet()

# Get the SERPAPI tool
tools = composio_toolset.get_tools(actions=[Action.SERPAPI_SEARCH])

# Get the tool string for agent_yaml
tool_section_str = composio_toolset.get_tools_section(tools)

# Example configuration
agent_yaml = """

""" + tool_section_str

# Create Agent4ALL instance with the agent_yaml content
praison_ai = Agent4ALL(agent_yaml=agent_yaml)

# Run Agent4ALL
result = praison_ai.main()

# Print the result
print(result)
```
